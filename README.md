# ObjectDetection_YOLO

Abstract- The object detection system for mobile robots is a
device that uses YOLO and OpenCVâ€™s contour methods to detect an
object and calculate the distance between it and our device. The main
purpose of this model is to clean the floor as and when it is moving as
it has a mop attached to it that can be detached, cleaned and reattached. The device detects an obstacle in front of it at a suitable
distance and turns from its current path to avoid collision. Not only is
this model very useful but ours is comparatively very cost efficient. It
is much simpler and affordable compared to its contemporaries
already present in the market
